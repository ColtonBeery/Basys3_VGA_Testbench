# Basys3_VGA_Testbench

The main purpose of this project will be to create a VGA test pattern generator that can generate multiple VGA test patterns on the fly and successfully output them onto a VGA monitor via the Basys 3â€™s built in VGA port. 

Thanks to Will Green for his great VGA graphics tutorial https://github.com/WillGreen/timetoexplore, which provided me with the VGA640x480 module that made the whole project possible.
